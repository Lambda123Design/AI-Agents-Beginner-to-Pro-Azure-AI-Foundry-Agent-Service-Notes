# **I) Intro to AI Agents:**

**A) Introduction to AI Agents**

This module introduces AI agents, focusing on their fundamentals, capabilities, and real-world applications. It covers Agentic AI, clarifying common misconceptions, and provides a simple demo to illustrate how an AI agent works. The session will define AI agents, highlight their key characteristics, and use a practical example—like Netflix or Amazon Prime’s recommendation system—to explain how AI agents function under the hood. Finally, the module will explore various real-world use cases across industries.

**B) What is Agentic AI ?**

This lesson explains the difference between non-agentic AI (zero-shot AI) and Agentic AI.

Non-agentic AI works in a single step: it generates output immediately without planning, reviewing, or refining. A real-life analogy is a student writing an exam essay without outlining or checking for errors—fast but potentially shallow or error-prone.

Agentic AI follows a step-by-step, iterative workflow, improving output as it goes. For example, when writing an essay, it first creates an outline, gathers data, drafts, reviews for mistakes, and then finalizes a polished version. The analogy is a student drafting, revising, and refining an essay.

Key takeaway: Non-agentic AI is quick but less precise, while Agentic AI is structured, iterative, and produces more refined results.

**C) Demo: AI Agents**

This section provides a real-world demo of an AI agent using a robotic vacuum cleaner as an example. The human gives a command (via app or button), and the vacuum autonomously makes decisions:

It avoids obstacles and cleans accessible areas.

It detects unsuitable surfaces (like carpet when mopping) and adjusts its actions accordingly.

Key takeaway: An AI agent can perceive its environment, make decisions, and act autonomously to achieve a goal.

**D) What are AI Agents?**

This lesson explains AI agents, their definition, key characteristics, and examples:

Definition: An AI agent is a system that observes its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions autonomously to achieve specific goals, without requiring constant human intervention. It can range from simple rule-based bots to advanced machine learning systems.

Key Characteristics:

Autonomous: Operates independently, e.g., robotic vacuum cleaners.

Reactive & Proactive: Responds to changes and takes initiative, e.g., smart thermostats.

Goal-Oriented: Designed to achieve specific objectives, e.g., chess-playing AI.

Adaptive: Learns from experience to improve performance, e.g., Netflix recommendation system.

Interactive: Communicates with humans or other systems, e.g., Alexa or Siri.

Examples of AI Agents: Chatbots (like ChatGPT), recommendation systems (Netflix), autonomous vehicles, and AI assistants (Alexa, Siri).

Key takeaway: An AI agent is a smart, interactive, and adaptive system that acts autonomously to achieve goals by perceiving, deciding, and acting in its environment.

**E) How an AI Agent Works ?**

This lesson explains how AI agents power recommendation systems, using Netflix/Amazon Prime as an example:

User Profiles & Preferences: Each user has a profile storing their viewing history and genre preferences.

Metadata Store: Contains details about movies (title, genre, year, description).

AI Agent Role: Acts as the coordinator, pulling user preferences, matching them with metadata, and deciding which movies to recommend.

Large Language Model (LLM) Role: Once movies are selected, the LLM generates a personalized, engaging email or message for the user (e.g., subject lines, friendly tone).

End-to-End Workflow: The AI agent integrates the selections and email content, then delivers the recommendations autonomously.

Key takeaway: AI agents combine user data, metadata, and LLMs to generate personalized, automated recommendations without human intervention.

**F) Use Cases of AI Agents in the Real World**

This lesson explores real-world applications of AI agents across industries:

Customer Service & Personalization:

Hyper-personalization: Recommend products/services based on user preferences (e.g., Netflix).

Intelligent call routing: Direct calls to the right department.

Customer feedback analysis: Identify positive/negative trends to improve services.

AI-driven CRM: Automate data entry and suggest optimal follow-up times.

Smart agent profiling: Categorize customers for targeted offers.

Chatbots with human touch: Handle routine queries, escalate complex issues.

Finance & Banking (FSI):

Fraud detection: Spot suspicious transactions.

Anti-money laundering: Track unusual transactions.

Risk management: Predict financial risks and flag risky loans.

# **II) Azure AI Foundry Basics (For Absolute Beginners)**

**A) Introduction to Azure AI Foundry**

Welcome to the module on Azure AI Foundry.

Now, if you are a beginner in the field of generative AI and are looking to learn about agents, I would definitely recommend that you check out my course in the Udemy catalog: Generative AI Beginner to Pro with OpenAI and Azure OpenAI. This course will take you from being a beginner to a pro in the field of Azure OpenAI.

The thing with Azure AI Foundry is that it has its history with the Azure OpenAI service. Initially, Microsoft offered the Azure OpenAI Studio, then they introduced AI Studio, and eventually rebranded it as Azure AI Foundry.

If you are new to this, I suggest going through this series of lectures. If you already have experience, you may feel free to skip certain sections. In these lectures, I will talk about the architecture of Azure AI Foundry, explain what a project is, what a hub is, and how it differs from the Azure OpenAI service.

We will explore how things have changed if you’ve been using the Azure OpenAI service and are now transitioning to Azure AI Foundry. Additionally, we will see how you can navigate the Azure AI Foundry portal and understand key differences. Did you know that you can use the Azure OpenAI service with or without a project?

We will also do some hands-on demos. We’ll create a hub, set up projects, and explore model benchmarks where you can compare different models available in the Foundry.

Furthermore, we’ll take a look at the various playgrounds that Microsoft provides, such as the chat playground and the agents playground, all accessible via the Foundry.

Finally, we will discuss the management center, which is crucial for governance and management of hubs and projects. I look forward to seeing you in the lectures!

**B) What is Azure AI Foundry?**

Now, the thing with Azure AI Foundry is that it has its own history. Microsoft has transitioned a lot over time. It all goes back to the days when Microsoft made a deal with OpenAI, agreeing to make the Azure OpenAI models available inside Azure.

Initially, we had the concept of Azure OpenAI Studio. Later, Microsoft introduced AI Studio, putting significant development effort into it so developers could work on AI projects using specific services. Even that didn’t fully meet their needs, so they eventually came up with Azure AI Foundry.

The word “foundry” is important. In English, a foundry is a factory where metal is melted and poured into molds to produce machine parts. Similarly, Azure AI Foundry is a platform where you can use AI models to build your projects.

Another important aspect is that Foundry isn’t limited to Azure OpenAI models. Microsoft has integrated a variety of models, including Meta’s LLaMA and DeepSeek, making these accessible within the platform.

Azure AI Foundry is a trusted platform that empowers developers to drive innovation safely, securely, and responsibly. Safety and security are core priorities, making it a reliable choice for organizations developing AI solutions. While it is still part of Azure, it operates on a dedicated domain accessible via ai.azure.com, separate from the main Azure portal.

The platform provides a model catalog, offering foundational, open-source, task-specific, and industry-specific AI models. For example, you can access OpenAI models, DeepSeek, or Meta LLaMA, depending on your project requirements.

Azure AI Foundry also integrates seamlessly with developer tools like Copilot Studio, Visual Studio, GitHub, and the Azure AI Foundry SDK. The SDK allows you to easily port different models between your projects—for example, switching from an OpenAI model to LLaMA or DeepSeek.

The platform includes core AI services such as Azure OpenAI Service, AI Search, and the new Azure AI Agent Service. Microsoft considers 2025–2026 as the era for AI agents, and the Foundry is built to support this focus. Additionally, it provides AI content safety, customization, and governance features. You can fine-tune models, perform evaluations, and ensure compliance and responsible AI usage.

In summary, Azure AI Foundry is a comprehensive platform that combines model access, developer tools, AI services, and enterprise-grade governance in one place.

In the next lecture, we will explore the architecture of Azure AI Foundry in detail.

**C) Architecture of Azure AI Foundry**

Back in December 2024, at Microsoft Ignite, Azure AI Foundry was officially introduced by Satya Nadella. The architecture highlights several important components, including the developer tools (IDEs), the model catalog, and observability. Let’s explore each of these components in detail.

Azure AI Foundry is a platform that provides access to a variety of AI models—not just OpenAI models but models from other vendors as well. It offers AI models, services, and integrations to help developers build, customize, and deploy AI-powered applications.

Starting with the left side of the architecture, we have the Azure AI Foundry development tools. These integrate seamlessly with popular development environments and tools. First, there is Copilot Studio, which is used to build AI-powered copilots. Then, we have Visual Studio, Microsoft’s popular integrated development environment (IDE). GitHub is also included, offering version control and collaboration for AI projects. Most importantly, there is the Azure AI Foundry SDK, a software development kit that allows developers to interact with AI models and services. The SDK is versatile and can be used across many different AI models, opening up a wide range of possibilities for AI developers.

Next, we move to the model catalog, which is a core component of Azure AI Foundry. The model catalog includes several types of models:

Foundation models: General-purpose AI models that can be applied to a variety of tasks.

Open-source models: Pre-trained models from the open-source community, such as Meta LLaMA and DeepSeek.

Task-specific models: AI models designed for specific use cases. Many of these are available in the model catalog to address particular tasks.

Industry models: AI solutions tailored for specific industries, allowing developers to leverage domain-specific capabilities.

The core AI services form the backbone of Azure AI Foundry. Previously, the Azure OpenAI service was a standalone offering, but now it has been integrated into the Foundry. Through the Azure OpenAI service, developers have access to OpenAI’s large language models, such as GPT-4 and upcoming models.

Other key services include Azure AI Search, which provides intelligent search and indexing capabilities, and the Azure AI Agent Service, which helps create AI agents that can automate tasks and workflows—an increasingly important focus for 2025–2026. Additionally, Azure AI Content Safety provides tools to ensure responsible AI usage by filtering harmful or inappropriate content.

Finally, we have the observability layer, which includes evaluations, customization, governance, and monitoring.

Evaluations involve assessing the performance of different AI models.

Customization allows fine-tuning models to meet specific project needs.

Governance ensures compliance, security, and responsible AI usage.

Monitoring tracks AI performance and identifies potential issues.

This observability layer provides transparency, continuous monitoring, and ongoing improvement of AI applications.

Overall, this comprehensive architecture highlights the beauty and power of Azure AI Foundry, combining models, services, developer tools, and governance into one cohesive platform.

**D) Projects vs Hubs**

Another key aspect you need to be aware of when studying Azure AI Foundry is the concept of projects and hubs. When working on AI projects, these are two components you will always use. A hub acts as a container, and inside it, you have projects. Think of it like this: the hub is the outer container, and the projects are the items inside it.

Hubs serve as a central AI governance and management layer across multiple projects. They facilitate the sharing and reuse of AI assets, which could include models, datasets, or even prompts. This makes hubs particularly valuable for organizations managing multiple AI projects. Before you create a project, you must first create a hub, highlighting their interdependency. Hubs provide a collaborative environment for teams to share project work, model endpoints, compute resources, data connections, security settings, and governance policies.

Once a hub is created, you can create a project within it. Projects are designed for developing and managing AI models and workflows. For example, if you want to use a model such as LLaMA, DeepSeek, or an Azure OpenAI resource, you must access it through a project. A project serves as a workspace for experimenting, fine-tuning, and deploying AI models. It is essentially your entry point for interacting with Azure AI Foundry.

Projects also support integration with various AI services, data sources, and pipelines. For instance, if you want to use Azure AI Search, you can do so through your project. Projects are ideal for managing the full AI development lifecycle, from experimentation to production. You can start small, test and fine-tune models, and then transition seamlessly to production.

Finally, AI projects group components for model customization, orchestrate workflows, and isolate data and access, ensuring secure and organized development. Hubs and projects together provide a robust framework for managing AI resources efficiently.

Don’t worry if this feels a bit confusing at first—I will demonstrate all of this in a proper demo in the upcoming lectures.
